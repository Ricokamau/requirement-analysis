# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring and documenting the process of **Requirement Analysis** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It includes definitions, importance, activities, requirement types, diagrams, and acceptance criteriaâ€”all crucial for delivering successful software projects.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a systematic process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the requirements of a software system. It acts as the foundation for all future project development stages and ensures that stakeholders and developers share a mutual understanding of what needs to be built.

It includes understanding user expectations, system functionality, and constraints, which helps avoid misunderstandings and rework later in the project lifecycle. It's a core part of the SDLC that ensures project success and aligns product goals with user needs.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Clarity and Alignment**  
   Ensures all stakeholders have a common understanding of the system requirements, reducing the chances of miscommunication.

2. **Minimizes Rework and Cost**  
   Catching requirement issues early saves time and resources by preventing costly changes in later stages.

3. **Improves Project Planning**  
   Accurate requirements help in better estimation of project scope, timelines, and resources.

   ## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collect information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observation, and documentation.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Actively extract and clarify needs through workshops, brainstorming sessions, and use case modeling.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Record the gathered requirements clearly using SRS (Software Requirements Specification) or user stories.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyze feasibility, conflicts, and completeness; use models like flowcharts, use case diagrams, and data flow diagrams.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Confirm with stakeholders that the documented requirements accurately reflect their needs.

  ## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

These define what the system should do.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
- Users can search available rooms by date.
- Admins can add, update, or delete listings.
- Users can make bookings and receive confirmations.

### Non-functional Requirements

These define how the system performs.

**Examples:**
- The system should load pages within 3 seconds.
- The booking service must be available 99.9% of the time.
- User data must be encrypted using AES-256.
