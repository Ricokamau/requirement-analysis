# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring and documenting the process of **Requirement Analysis** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It includes definitions, importance, activities, requirement types, diagrams, and acceptance criteriaâ€”all crucial for delivering successful software projects.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a systematic process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the requirements of a software system. It acts as the foundation for all future project development stages and ensures that stakeholders and developers share a mutual understanding of what needs to be built.

It includes understanding user expectations, system functionality, and constraints, which helps avoid misunderstandings and rework later in the project lifecycle. It's a core part of the SDLC that ensures project success and aligns product goals with user needs.
